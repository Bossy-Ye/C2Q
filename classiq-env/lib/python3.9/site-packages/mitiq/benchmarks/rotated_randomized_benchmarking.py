    Generates a list of "rotated" randomized benchmarking circuits.
    This benchmarking method enables testing QEM techniques in more general
    scenarios, closer to real-world applications in which expectation values
    can take arbitrary values.

    Rotated randomized bencmarking circuits are randomized benchmarking
    circuits with an :math:`R_z(\theta)` rotation inserted in the middle, such
    that:

    .. math::
        C(\theta) =    G_n \dots G_{n/2 +1} R_z(\theta)G_{n/2} \dots G_2 G_1

    where :math:`G_j` are Clifford elements or Clifford gates.

    For most values of the seed, the probability of the zero state is a
    sinusoidal function of :math:`\theta`. For some values of the seed
    the probability of the zero state is 1 for all :math:`\theta`.

    Since (up to factors of 2) we have
    :math:`R_z(\theta) =cos(\theta) I +  i \ sin(\theta) Z`, the rotated
    Clifford circuit :math:`C(\theta)` can be written as a linear combination
    of just two Clifford circuits, and therefore it is still easy to
    classically simulate.

    Args:
        n_qubits: The number of qubits. Can be either 1 or 2.
        num_cliffords: The number of Clifford group elements in the
            random circuits. This is proportional to the depth per circuit.
        theta: The rotation angle about the :math:`Z` axis.
        trials: The number of random circuits to return.
        return_type: String which specifies the type of the
            returned circuits. See the keys of
            ``mitiq.SUPPORTED_PROGRAM_TYPES`` for options. If ``None``, the
            returned circuits have type ``cirq.Circuit``.
        seed: A seed for generating radomzed benchmarking circuits.


    Returns:
        A list of rotated randomized benchmarking circuits.
