    """Samples a list of implementable sequences from the quasi-probability
    representation of the input ideal operation.
    Returns the list of sequences, the corresponding list of signs and the
    one-norm of the quasi-probability representation (of the input operation).

    For example, if the ideal operation is U with representation U = a A + b B,
    then this function returns A with probability :math:`|a| / (|a| + |b|)` and
    B with probability :math:`|b| / (|a| + |b|)`. Also returns sign(a)
    (sign(b)) and :math:`|a| + |b|` if A (B) is sampled.

    Note that the ideal operation can be a sequence of operations (circuit),
    for instance U = V W, as long as a representation is known. Similarly, A
    and B can be sequences of operations (circuits) or just single operations.

    Args:
        ideal_operation: The ideal operation from which an implementable
            sequence is sampled.
        representations: A list of representations of ideal operations in a
            noisy basis. If no representation is found for `ideal_operation`,
            a ValueError is raised.
        random_state: Seed for sampling.
        num_samples: The number of samples.

    Returns:
        The tuple (``sequences``, ``signs``, ``norm``) where
        ``sequences`` are the sampled sequences,
        ``signs`` are the signs associated to the sampled ``sequences`` and
        ``norm`` is the one-norm of the quasi-probability distribution.
