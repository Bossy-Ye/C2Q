    r"""Returns the quasi-probability representation of the input
    single-qubit ``ideal_operation`` with respect to a basis of noisy
    operations.

    Any ideal single-qubit unitary followed by local amplitude-damping noise
    of equal ``noise_level`` is assumed to be in the basis of implementable
    operations.

    The representation is based on the analytical result presented
    in :cite:`Takagi2020`.

    Args:
        ideal_operation: The ideal operation (as a QPROGRAM) to represent.
        noise_level: The noise level of each amplitude damping channel.
        is_qubit_dependent: If True, the representation corresponds to the
            operation on the specific qubits defined in `ideal_operation`.
            If False, the representation is valid for the same gate even if
            acting on different qubits from those specified in
            `ideal_operation`.

    Returns:
        The quasi-probability representation of the ``ideal_operation``.

    .. note::
        The input ``ideal_operation`` is typically a QPROGRAM with a single
        gate but could also correspond to a sequence of more gates.
        This is possible as long as the unitary associated to the input
        QPROGRAM, followed by a single final amplitude damping channel, is
        physically implementable.

    .. note::
        The input ``ideal_operation`` must be a ``cirq.Circuit``.
