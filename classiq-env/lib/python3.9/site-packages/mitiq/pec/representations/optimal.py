    Returns the list of real coefficients :math:`[x_0, x_1, \dots]`,
    which minimizes :math:`\sum_j |x_j|` with the contraint that
    the following representation of the input ``ideal_matrix`` holds:

    .. math::
        \text{ideal_matrix} = x_0 A_0 + x_1 A_1 + \cdots

    where :math:`\{A_j\}` are the basis matrices, i.e., the elements of
    the input ``basis_matrices``.

    This function can be used to compute the optimal representation
    of an ideal superoperator (or Choi state) as a linear
    combination of real noisy superoperators (or Choi states).

    Args:
        ideal_matrix: The ideal matrix to represent.
        basis_matrices: The list of basis matrices.
        tol: The error tolerance for each matrix element
            of the represented matrix.
        initial_guess: Optional initial guess for the coefficients
            :math:`[x_0, x_1, \dots]`.

    Returns:
        The list of optimal coefficients :math:`[x_0, x_1, \dots]`.

        noisy_operations: The basis in which the ``ideal_operation``
            should be represented. Must be a list of ``NoisyOperation`` objects
            which are initialized with a numerical superoperator matrix.
        tol: The error tolerance for each matrix element
            of the represented operation.
        initial_guess: Optional initial guess for the coefficients
            :math:`\{ \eta_\alpha \}`.
        is_qubit_dependent: If True, the representation corresponds to the
            operation on the specific qubits defined in `ideal_operation`.
            If False, the representation is valid for the same gate even if
            acting on different qubits from those specified in
