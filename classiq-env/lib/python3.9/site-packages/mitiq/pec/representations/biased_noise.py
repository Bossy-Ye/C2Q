    r"""This function maps an
    ``ideal_operation`` :math:`\mathcal{U}` into its quasi-probability
    representation, which is a linear combination of noisy implementable
    operations :math:`\sum_\alpha \eta_{\alpha} \mathcal{O}_{\alpha}`.

    This function assumes a combined depolarizing and dephasing noise model
    with a bias factor :math:`\eta` (see :cite:`Strikis_2021_PRXQuantum`)
    and that the following noisy operations are implementable
    :math:`\mathcal{O}_{\alpha} = \mathcal{D} \circ \mathcal P_\alpha`
    where :math:`\mathcal{U}` is the unitary associated
    to the input ``ideal_operation``,
    :math:`\mathcal{P}_\alpha` is a Pauli operation and

    .. math::
        \mathcal{D}(\epsilon) = (1 - \epsilon)[\mathbb{1}] +
        \epsilon(\frac{\eta}{\eta + 1} \mathcal{Z}
        + \frac{1}{3}\frac{1}{\eta + 1}(\mathcal{X} + \mathcal{Y}
        + \mathcal{Z}))

    is the combined (biased) dephasing and depolarizing channel acting on a
    single qubit. For multi-qubit operations, we use a noise channel that is
    the tensor product of the local single-qubit channels.

    Args:
        ideal_operation: The ideal operation (as a QPROGRAM) to represent.
        epsilon: The local noise severity (as a float) of the combined channel.
        eta: The noise bias between combined dephasing and depolarizing
            channels with :math:`\eta = 0` describing a fully depolarizing
            channel and :math:`\eta = \infty` describing a fully dephasing
            channel.
        is_qubit_dependent: If True, the representation corresponds to the
            operation on the specific qubits defined in `ideal_operation`.
            If False, the representation is valid for the same gate even if
            acting on different qubits from those specified in
            `ideal_operation`.

    Returns:
        The quasi-probability representation of the ``ideal_operation``.

    .. note::
        This representation is based on the ideal assumption that one
        can append Pauli gates to a noisy operation without introducing
        additional noise. For a backend which violates this assumption,
        it remains a good approximation for small values of ``epsilon``.

    .. note::
        The input ``ideal_operation`` is typically a QPROGRAM with a single
        gate but could also correspond to a sequence of more gates.
        This is possible as long as the unitary associated to the input
        QPROGRAM, followed by a single final biased noise channel, is
        physically implementable.
