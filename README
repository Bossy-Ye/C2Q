IMPLEMENTED

1. VARIABLE TYPES: int, float, value, array
2. CONTROL FLOW: for loop, while loop, if else, etc.,
3. function(subroutines)
4. assignment (variable declaration): normal assignment, argument assignment(such as: '+=', '-=')

LIMITATION:
1. IN PYTHON, we dont have variable declaring, apply keyword "value" for most of the declaration(except float and uint32 currently).
2. There is no else if in QASM3.0, but I still apply it (translate from .py directly).
run $ python3 demo4.py
